**Q. After content is uploaded on the platform, do updates made to the original content in the organization’s repository reflect automatically in platform's repository?**

Two scenarios imply here:

* If the platform has only one common repository for all the organizations, the changes in the content automatically reflect in the common repository.
* If the organization maintains a separate repository, the content in that repository does not automatically reflect in the platform's repository. Any updates made to content in the organization's repository must be re-uploaded on the platform's site. The uploaded content undergoes the review process, before it is re-published on the platform.

Content that is already submitted to the platform repository can be modified using platform's in-built content editor. To make changes or modify uploaded content:

1. Click Edit on the content to be modified
1. Modify the content
1. Save the changes
1. Send the artefact for review
1. The artefact will be published after review

**Q. Does any change in the organization’s content repository affect the content repository on the platform?**

The content in the organization’s repository does not automatically reflect in the platform's repository. Changes to the organization’s repository do not affect the platform's content repository.

**Q. Is the content provided stored in platform’s repository?**

All content uploaded and published on the platform is stored in platform's content repository.
