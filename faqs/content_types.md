- **Content** can be broadly defined as the principle matter such as written information, illustrations etc. available on a website. However, content may vary from type to type across adaptations of Sunbird. For example, on DIKSHA, an adaptation of Sunbird, chief content types are: course, textbook, lesson, worksheet, collection and story. Similarly, other instances of Sunbird can have personilzed content types to suit custom requirements.

- **Course** is content provided in sequence, broken down in modules, open for enrolment and completion for a duration. You can attach prerequisites for a course, and it may contain assessments.

- **Book** is a collection of content units. It can be compiled or curated from school textbooks that conform to syllabi of state or central boards, for a grade, in the said medium of instruction and language. Text books may also be compiled separately without adhering to any syllabus, but forming a logical unit of content pieces for the given subject matter.
