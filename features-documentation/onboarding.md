Sunbird has the provision to register and provide user credentials (user ID and password) to organizations, such as states, NGO and other organized body of individuals.

The states and organizations make a policy decision to allow / disallow registering single individual users. Contact your organization administrator for details.

Signing up on Sunbird is a seamless process. Any organized, recognized education or learning body can add their members as registered users of the platform. For example; an organization, state, NGO, certification body or study centre can add their staff and users as Sunbird users.
