The **Administrator Dashboard** provides the administrator a unified view of the organization's content creation and consumption patterns. The data collected from multiple components is integrated and graphically represented. This helps to gauge and assess the value, popularity and acceptance of content created and used on the portal. The dashboard shows views of content created, reviewed, published, consumed etc. Administrators can also download the data as a .csv file.
