Making content available for use follows a simple process with recommended guidelines. Its all about creating it, ensuring quality through exacting reviews and publishing it for consumption by others. Once published, it needs to be managed for archival and deletion. Administrators provide registered users with appropriate rights for each stage in the lifecycle.
