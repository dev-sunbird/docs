## Overview
There are various user roles on Sunbird. Each user has a unique role to play in their respective organizations. Organization administrators assign one or many responsibilities to users on Sunbird. Extending the literal meaning of workspace, a space to work, Sunbird provides a unique workspace to suit the work needs of each user.  

In this section of documentation, we discuss the workspace of users who create and curate content on Sunbird.

### Understanding your Workspace

The workspace interface varies based on the role assigned to the user. For instance, a book reviewer has only the create book tile, while a content content would have all the tiles viz., collection, course, lesson plan, and, study material. The image used displays all the options in the workspace as it would appear for an organization administrator.
